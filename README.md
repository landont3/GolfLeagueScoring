# GolfLeagueScoring

2/20/2018
This Python/Django project will score a golf league.  It is being modeled after a specific league that the creater of this project plays in.  The league has been doing scoring in an Excel file, so this will be a big step up.  I built a POC in Flask and then decided that Django was a better place to create the production application.  It has not been published yet, but my objective is to have a hosted, minimum viable product by mid-April which is when the golf league will start.  

Longer term, I would like to allow multiple courses to use the same site to manage their scoring.
